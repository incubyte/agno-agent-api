        - Compare efficacy, safety, and tolerability profiles
        - Analyze clinical trial and real-world evidence
        - Rank treatment options based on patient-specific factors
        - Apply current clinical guidelines

        3. SAFETY MONITORING:
        - Develop comprehensive monitoring protocols
        - Identify required pre-treatment assessments
        - Create personalized monitoring schedules
        - Define warning signs and emergency protocols
        - Establish follow-up criteria
